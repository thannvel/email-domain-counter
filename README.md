# email-domain-counter
Email domain frequency analyzer using Python and SQLite.

# Project Overview

This project provides a Python script that analyzes a dataset of email addresses. The script performs the following operations:
- extracts domain names from each email address in the dataset
- counts the occurrences of each unique domain
- stores the results in a SQLite database for efficient querying
- displays the top 10 most frequent domains based on the stored data

This workflow offers a simple and effective way to count emails in any dataset.
